# HV 250-8
Voltage source for Creation Trap (CT)

Supply of stable DC voltages (+/- 250V) with 8 output channels
LCD display has two modes:
- Protocol Mode: all commands, which are received via the USB connection are listed, subsequently one after another
- Voltage mode: all programmed voltages are listed, sorted by channels

---
Cycle time (command <-> Response): 35ms to 40ms

---
Remote commands:

IDN | “HVXXX 250 8 b”
DDDDD CHXX Y.YYYYYY | CHXX Y.YYYYYY
DDDDD QXX | +/-yy,yyy V (in voltage)
DDDDD TEMP | TEMP XXX.XºC
DDDDD LOCK | B3B2B1B0

With check locking status the first 4 bits (= upper nibble) of every Byte is always 0001 = 16dec
in B3: ch16 ch15 ch14 ch13
in B2: ch12 ch11 ch10 ch09
in B1: ch08 ch07 ch06 ch05
in B0: ch04 ch03 ch02 ch01

where 0 - locked, 1 - not locked


Settling time:  Under moderate loads the output will be accurate to better 0.1% of span in less than 5 sec., after any
change of voltage on a certain channel.
